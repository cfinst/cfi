Act 209, SLH 2015 (H.B. 1491): Effective January 1, 2016, the bill requires additional reporting by noncandidate committees solely making independent expenditures (i.e., Super PACs) for contributions aggregating more than $10,000 on their disclosure reports and greater than $5,000 on their late contribution reports from contributing entities that are not individuals, for-profit business entities or labor unions. This law requires Super PACs to report: (1) the internet address where a contributing entity's disclosure report can be publicly accessed; (2) the name, address, occupation, and employer of each funding source of $100 or more to the contributing entity; or (3) an acknowledgment that the contributing entity is not subject to any state or federal disclosure reporting requirements regarding the source of the contributing entity's funds.","MOLEFI MCINTOSH (2016 only)","September 12, 2017",,
