Qualifying matching contributions are those of $250 or less from an individual, made after September 1 of the calendar year prior to the election. Aggregate contributions from an individual in excess of $250 will be matched only up to $250. A contribution from an individual, if made by check, must be drawn on the personal bank account of the individual making the contribution, as opposed to any form of business account, regardless of whether the business account is for a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, trust, or other form of business arrangement. For contributions made by check from a personal joint account, the match shall only be for the individual who actually signs the check. ((b) Contributions from individuals who at the time of contributing are not state residents may not be used to meet the threshold amounts in paragraph (a).
