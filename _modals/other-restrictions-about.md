In addition to financial limits, many laws contain other kinds of regulations and prohibitions that relate to contributions and spending.

For example, about half of the states used to prohibit corporations and labor unions from using their treasury money for independent expenditures until the Supreme Court’s declared these prohibitions to be unconstitutional in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010). And many states continue to prohibit corporations and labor unions from contributing their treasury money directly to candidates. 

Some states used to put a maximum ceiling on the amount any individual donors could give to all candidates and parties combined, until the Supreme Court held that kind of restriction to be unconstitutional in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (2014).  And some may have special limits for lobbyists, or prohibit fundraising during a legislative session, or prohibit foreign national from giving.

As is true everywhere in this database, the visualizations present only a small portion of what is in the full database. It is also important to note that they only present statute law. They do not present administrative or judicial interpretations of the law – which can often be crucial for understanding what a law “really means” to the candidates and others who live under it. The one situation in which we do go beyond the statute is if a final ruling of the highest state or federal court determines a provision to be unconstitutional. If that occurs, and the state has not formally repealed the provision in another statute, we then code the provision as being “inoperative”.
