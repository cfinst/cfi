About half of the states provide some form of public financing incentive for candidates or political parties. The programs for candidates may come in the form of

  1. full public financing flat grants to cover all of a candidate's spending,
  2. partial grants to be combined with private fundraising,
  3. matching funds in which a state matches a donor's contributions to qualified candidates up to a specific dollar amount, and
  4. government-funded vouchers given to all registered voters (or residents) that may then be handed over to a candidate.

  States also use tax credits, tax deductions, earmarked tax money, or direct refunds to reimburse a donor up to a specific amount for giving a contribution to a qualified candidate or political party. Assistance to political parties, where it exists, will usually come through one of these tax incentive or refund programs.
