title: About Disclosure

Every state requires candidates, parties and other political committees to disclose the names and other information about their donors. But after that one basic point of agreement, there is great variation. For example, most states (but not all) tell the recipients that they need not disclose the names and addresses of small donors. However, the threshold levels for disclosing this donor information vary from state to state. Some of visualizations on this disclosure tab display these thresholds. The tab also displays information about independent expenditure disclosure, and the laws that require donor disclosure within advertisements.

All of these features of the law fit neatly into decades-old categories. However, many of the major policy questions of recent years have revolved around organizations that do not fit into traditional boxes. Since the 2010 Supreme Court decision in _Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_, corporations (including nonprofit advocacy organizations) have been allowed to make unlimited independent expenditures. These organizations often are not “political committees” under the law and therefore do not normally disclose their donors. As they try to maintain the value of transparency, some jurisdictions have extended their laws to require donor information from organizations other than political committees. Some have also sought to track money back to the original source even if it passes through layers of intermediate organizations. For that reason, the visualized information includes a question about states that require disclosure by “other entities.”

The full database includes more about these new disclosure issues, as well as many more details about the more traditional disclosures required of candidates, parties, PACs, and ballot committees. It also includes entries for the disclosure of corporate spending to shareholders, and requirements for electronic filing.
