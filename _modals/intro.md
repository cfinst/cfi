  Take the tour!

Each of the graphic visualizations derived from the historical database of state
campaign finance laws involves both a map and a grid.

 * Use the tabs at the top to navigate between topics.
 * Use the controls on the right to navigate between fields.

### Grid

Each of the fifty states has a column in the grid. The horizontal rows represent
years taken every two years, with the most recent completed year at the top. In
the default setting, the grid uses the most recent year to line up the states in
order of the answers to the question you are asking. The key to this sorting is
shown to the right of the map. Looking up and down any one state's column will
show if and when the state changed its law. Hovering the cursor over any box
will give some of the details for each state and year.

### Map

The map will show the most recent year by default. Hovering the cursor over a
state will show details for the year being shown.

### Sorting

Clicking on any year at the left of the grid will rearrange the grid according
to the values in the year chosen. It will also change the map to show the laws
for that year. There is also an option to sort the states alphabetically.

#### _Downloading_

You may download the answers to your specific question in a standard format that
you can view in a spreadsheet or other program. You may also download all of the
visualized information, or larger portions of the complete (and much larger)
historical database.
